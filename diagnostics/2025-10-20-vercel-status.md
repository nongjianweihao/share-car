# Vercel Deployment Check (2025-10-20)

- **Deployment URL:** https://share-car.vercel.app
- **Status:** Accessible. Verified by loading the page via an automated Chromium session (Playwright) which returned the rendered interface without runtime errors.
- **Build health:** `npm run build` succeeds locally, producing the `dist/` output directory.

If access issues persist for certain users, they may be related to network restrictions rather than the deployment itself. In that case, confirm external connectivity to Vercel from the affected environment.
